This is an exploration of loss. The broad strokes of this project are as follows:

The project will allow people to think through the prompt, "What does it take to remove [thing] from [your life/society]?" I first imagined this project in terms of relationships: after losing a lifelong friend, I drew a massive graph of all of the things it would take to remove her from my life, starting with concrete things like gifts and ending with more abstract things, like verbal tics we had developed or instinctual car routes. The exercise helped me think through the dependencies within relationships, how deeply interwoven my material, social, and psychological life was with her. I wanted to conduct interviews with people as part of an art project, asking them to perform the same exercise and sketch out networks of loss. This project takes that line of thinking and expands it, broadening the prompt to include social issues like "policing," which addresses an entirely different realm of relationships but deserves the same form of thought: what are all of the hidden dependencies?
