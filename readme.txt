This is an exploration of loss. The broad strokes of this project are as follows:

The project will allow people to think through the prompt, "What would you need to remove from your life in order to fully remove [thing]?" I originally intend this to think about relationships, but I think it could be an interesting exploration of the removal of many things. So, a person could choose to remove their grandmother from their life, and then they will have to reckon with the things required to remove her entirely. From here on out, it is completely up to the person to decide how they approach this exercise. They start with a central node of the thing they're removing, and then they can attack nodes to it. Each node has all of the following possibilities: give a title, draw a small image, write a short description, add labels, and determine its contribution to the loss in terms of percentage (this last one does not apply to the automatically generated central node). 

The website will have 3 pages: index, lose, and gallery. Index, the landing page, will feature a short description of the project and its impetus. Lose will be the main focus of the website, and it will allow people to create networks of loss. Gallery will feature user creations. The navigation will highlight the page you're on, and will read "home", "lose something", and "gallery".

Lose will have a number of features:
1. At the top, a prompt will read, "Today, I'll try to remove ______ from my life." The user will be able to enter a term in the blank, and from there the process begins.
2. The first node created will be titled after whatever the user put into it.
